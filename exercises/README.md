# Exercise Template

This directory contains exercises from the Advanced Machine Learning course.

## Structure

Each exercise should follow this structure:

```
exercise_name/
├── README.md           # Exercise description and requirements
├── data/              # Exercise-specific data files
├── analysis.py        # Data analysis script
├── features.py        # Feature engineering script
├── model.py           # Model training and evaluation
└── notebook.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook (optional)
```

## Exercise List

Exercises will be added here as they are received from the tutor.

### Template Exercise Components

1. **Data Analysis**: Explore and understand the dataset
   - Load data using Pandas
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize distributions and relationships
   - Identify missing values and outliers

2. **Feature Engineering**: Create and transform features
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Create new features
   - Scale/normalize features
   - Feature selection

3. **Model Training**: Build and train models
   - Split data into train/test sets
   - Select appropriate algorithms
   - Train models with different hyperparameters
   - Cross-validation

4. **Model Tuning**: Optimize model performance
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model evaluation metrics
   - Compare different models
   - Final model selection

## Getting Started

To start a new exercise:

1. Create a new directory for your exercise
2. Copy the template structure
3. Follow the problem requirements
4. Document your approach and findings

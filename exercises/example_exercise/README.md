# Example Exercise: Data Analysis and Model Building

This is a template exercise that demonstrates the typical workflow for a machine learning problem.

## Problem Statement

Build a machine learning model to predict [target variable] based on [features description].

## Dataset

- Source: [Dataset source/link]
- Size: [Number of rows and columns]
- Features: [List of features]
- Target: [Target variable]

## Requirements

1. **Data Analysis**
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Check for missing values
   - Visualize feature distributions
   - Analyze correlations

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Create new features if needed
   - Scale/normalize features

3. **Model Training**
   - Split data into train/test sets
   - Train multiple models
   - Compare model performance

4. **Model Tuning**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning
   - Select best model
   - Evaluate final model

## Expected Deliverables

- Analysis script with EDA
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Trained model(s)
- Evaluation report
- (Optional) Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis
